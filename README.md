# Tennis Court 3D Modeling Project

A 3D tennis court model created using **Autodesk Maya**. This project showcases skills in 3D modeling, texturing, lighting, and scene composition.

---

## Project Overview

### Objective
To design and render a realistic tennis court environment while exploring advanced features of Autodesk Maya.

### Features
- Accurate tennis court proportions and markings.
- Detailed elements such as a realistic net, boundary fencing, and props.
- Natural daylight simulation with proper lighting and shadows.

---

## Tools and Software
- **Autodesk Maya 2025**: Modeling, texturing, and scene setup.
- **Arnold Renderer**: High-quality rendering.
- **Photoshop (Optional)**: For texture creation and enhancements.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Modeling
- Designed the base court layout using planes and cubes.
- Added elements like the net, poles, and boundary fencing.

### 2. Texturing
- Applied realistic texture maps using Mayaâ€™s Hypershade.
- Focused on clean and polished materials for the court and surrounding objects.

### 3. Lighting
- Set up directional lighting to simulate natural daylight.
- Fine-tuned shadows for realism.

### 4. Scene Composition
- Arranged all elements for visual clarity and appeal.
- Ensured balanced detail without overcomplicating the scene.

## Screenshots
Include screenshots from different angles and details, e.g.:
- Top view of the court
- Texturing process
- Rendered scene

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenges
- Achieving realistic lighting and textures.
- Managing rendering times for complex scenes.

### Solutions
- Optimized geometry and materials.
- Used Arnold Renderer settings to balance quality and performance.
